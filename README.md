This repo shows, summarizes, and explains common Ruby syntax & object oriented 
programming (OOP) design in Ruby for beginners. 
(syntax.rb & object_oriented_samples.rb files, respectively)

It also has a collection of small Ruby programs, each of which teach a basic
Ruby topic. 
(sample_programs.rb file)

Basic programming knowledge assumed. 
Initially put together as notes for personal use, I thought it might be of 
benefit to others. 

Enjoy!
