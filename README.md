This repo shows, summarizes, and explains common Ruby syntax & object oriented 
programming (OOP) design in Ruby for beginners.<br> 
(syntax.rb & object_oriented_syntax_and_samples.rb files, respectively)

It also has a collection of small Ruby programs, each of which teach a basic
Ruby topic. <br>
(sample_programs.rb file)

Basic programming knowledge assumed. <br><br>
Initially put together as notes for personal use, I thought it might be of 
benefit to others. 

Enjoy!
